Yes, Rust exclusively uses the stack and heap for memory storage. There are no other memory storage locations in the Rust memory model.

This two-part memory model (stack and heap) is fundamental to how Rust manages memory, and all data in a Rust program must exist in one of these two locations:

1. **Stack**: For fixed-size, automatically managed memory
2. **Heap**: For dynamically-sized or long-lived data

Rust doesn't use additional memory regions that some other languages or systems might employ, such as:

- No garbage-collected memory region
- No special global memory area (globals in Rust still use either stack or heap)
- No register-only variables (though the compiler may optimize some variables into registers)
- No specialized memory pools (though libraries can implement these on top of heap allocations)

The distinction between stack and heap is particularly important in Rust because:

1. The ownership system tracks which part of code is responsible for freeing heap memory
2. The borrowing rules ensure memory safety without garbage collection
3. The lifetimes system ties references to specific scopes in the program

Even more complex memory features in Rust, like static variables (with the `static` keyword), are still ultimately backed by either stack or heap storage, just with special lifetime rules.

This simplicity in the memory model is intentional and helps Rust achieve both memory safety and performance without the need for a garbage collector.
